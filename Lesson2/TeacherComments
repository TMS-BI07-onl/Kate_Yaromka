Well done!

a) -1 
Correct answer:	SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT PersonType) AS DistinctCount
		FROM Person.Person
		WHERE LastName LIKE 'M%' 
			OR NOT EmailPromotion LIKE '%1%' 
You forgot to add count. When the task is about calculating amount of rows, you can't rely on the number in the corner of the window.
First condition is "starting with M". In your solution it's "equal to M", which is totally not correct.
Second condition is not "equal", it's "including". For example, if after next data update there is a EmailPromotion 3451654, it should be added to the final result set.
b)-1
Correct answer:
SELECT  TOP 3   *
FROM Sales.SpecialOffer
WHERE StartDate BETWEEN '2013-01-01' AND '2014-01-01'
ORDER BY DiscountPct DESC
Order by is the most necessary function here. You got wrong results just because of this line.
e)-0.5
Having clause is absolutely not needed here. 
Firstly, we haven't spoken about it yet. Secondly, there is not a single requirement about filtering out null values for weight and size.

Mark: 8.
